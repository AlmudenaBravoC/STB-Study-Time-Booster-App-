# STB-Study-Time-Booster-App

Nowadays, there is a trend among students to procrastinate, which naturally leads to more stress and having to process a great deal of information in very little time. This is due to the lack of organizational tools available, being intuitive to the average user. 
Study Time Booster, a tool which will help you organize your schedule to improve your performance in your studies 
The main screen allows you to choose between 4 different actions: Study Time, Tasks, Find service and Sleep. 
The Study Time option enables you to use the Pomodoro Technique


Study Time Booster allows the user to input the desired pomodoros he/she wishes to do and sets the timer for 25 minutes as studying time. However, it is now set to 5 seconds for visualization purposes. Now, you can either choose to play our games during your break or simply set the timer for the five-minute break.

During each short break the app offers 3 areas of short activities: movement, history, and curiosities.
When the break is over, you will be re-directed to the pomodoro screen and resume your previous task. 
The Task option re-directs the user to a screen where you can add a task that will show up in this screen. There is also a button that enables the user to add a new event in the calendar, where you can choose the type of submission (exam/assignment), the course and the deadline
Finally, the Sleep option will allow the user to set an alarm clock for the following day. As a default, the alarm will be set to 8h later. However, you can set your alarm clock as you wish if you don’t want to follow the app’s advice. 

## Run the app
You will need to download the zip and then open a new project in Android Studio where you will be able to modify and run the mobile app.
